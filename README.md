# NitPick

NitPick is a React + TypeScript web app for FE exam preparation.

It includes:
- Mock exam generation from the question vault
- Configurable exam setup (timed/untimed, question count, topic filters)
- Instant answer reveal mode with explanation support
- Results analytics (score, percentage, pass/fail, category breakdown, wrong-question review)
- Previous exams browser grouped by year, with dropdown question review

## Data Source

Questions are loaded from markdown files under philnits-vault. The app parses each markdown file and extracts:
- Question text
- Choices (A-D)
- Correct answer
- Explanation text
- Inferred category/topic

Markdown and math in explanations are rendered in HTML using:
- react-markdown
- remark-gfm
- remark-math
- rehype-katex
- katex
